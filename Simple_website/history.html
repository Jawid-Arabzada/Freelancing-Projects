<h1>History</h1>


<mark>Establishment of the Kulliyyah of Information and Communication Technology</mark>
<p>

It was at the First International Conference on Information Sysytems and Islam held in 2001 at IIUM that the then Rector of IIUM, Prof. Tan Sri Dr. Mohd Kamal Hassan announced the establishment of the Kulliyyah of Information and Communication Technology (KICT) at IIUM and named the first Dean of KICT.
</p>
<p>
The establishment of KICT was made possible with the merger of two departments of the university being the Department of Information System (DIS) from the Kulliyyah of Economics and Management Sciences (KENMS) and the Department of Library and Information Sciences (DLIS) from Kulliyyah of Islamic Revealed Knowledge and Human Sciences (KIRKHS). Information Technology had and continues to bring about developments that have revolutionized traditional society signaling changes to its philosophy, culture, economy and many aspects of our lives. It was imperative therefore to bring together all studies related to Information and Communication Technology under one umbrella. 
</p>
<p>
The DIS began by offering the Bachelor in Management Information Systems (BMIS) programme which was later changed to the Bachelor of Information Technology (BIT) on the advice of the Ministry of Higher Education. The DIS later added postgraduate programmes namely the Master in Information Technology (MIT) by research and course work and the PhD in Information Technology (PhD IT) by research.
